# Tkinter Calendar Widget with Date Display

This Python script provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to display a calendar widget and a label that shows the selected date from the calendar. It allows users to select a date from the calendar and then displays that selected date on the label.

## Prerequisites

- `tkinter` library (usually included with Python)
- `tkcalendar` library (install using `pip install tkcalendar`)

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory where the `date_picker_calendar.py` script is located.

2. Run the script using the following command:

python date_picker_calendar.py
```

3. The script will launch a GUI window displaying a calendar widget and a button labeled "Get Date."

4. Click on any date in the calendar widget to select it. The selected date will be displayed below the calendar.

5. Click the "Get Date" button to display the selected date on the label.
